## Objectives

The main goal of this case study is to build ML models to predict churn. The predictive models we're going to construct will serve the following purposes:

1.**Predict Churn:**

- We can use ML models to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in the near future (i.e., churn phase).
- Action Steps: Based on predictions, we can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge, etc.

2.**Identify Important Variables:**

- We can use ML models to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn.
- Insight: These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

- Although overall accuracy will be the primary evaluation metric, we should consider other metrics like precision, recall, etc.
- Example: In one scenario, we may need higher accuracy in identifying customers who'll definitely churn.

**Recommendations:**

- Based on our observations, we can recommend strategies to manage customer churn effectively.

**Note:**

- Multiple models may be necessary to fulfill the objectives.
- We should consider using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA before building predictive models.

**Modeling Approach:**

- We can use PCA to reduce dimensionality.
- After PCA, we can employ any classification model for churn prediction.
- Note: PCA components are not easy to interpret; thus, another model is needed to identify important predictor attributes.

**Second Model:**

- We'll build another model to identify important predictor attributes.
- Consider logistic regression or a model from the tree family.



## Customer Churn: Usage and High-Value Customers

Customer churn, as we saw earlier, is the rate at which customers stop using a company's product or service. But churn can be further categorized based on customer behavior and value. Here, we'll explore two specific types:

**1. Usage-Based Churn**

***Concept:** Usage-based churn refers to customers who churn due to **low engagement or infrequent use** of the product/service.

***Identification:** Businesses with tiered subscription plans or freemium models can often identify usage-based churn. Customers who consistently fall within the lowest usage tiers or never upgrade from free plans might be at risk of churning.

***Example:**  A cloud storage service offers free storage with limited capacity. Users who consistently reach storage limits without upgrading to paid plans with higher capacity exhibit usage-based churn behavior.

**2. High-Value Customer Churn**

***Concept:** High-value churn refers to the loss of customers who generate significant revenue or contribute heavily to a company's growth.

***Identification:** This type of churn is crucial to identify as high-value customers contribute significantly to the bottom line. Businesses can analyze customer purchase history, subscription plans, or engagement metrics to pinpoint high-value customers.

***Example:** An e-commerce platform identifies customers who consistently place large orders or subscribe to premium memberships. Losing such customers is considered high-value churn.

Understanding these different types of churn allows companies to implement targeted strategies for customer retention:

***Reduce Usage-Based Churn:**

* Implement onboarding tutorials and user guides to improve product familiarity.
* Design personalized marketing campaigns to highlight features relevant to specific customer segments.
* Offer tiered subscription plans catering to different usage needs.

***Minimize High-Value Customer Churn:**

* Conduct customer satisfaction surveys to understand their needs and concerns.
* Provide dedicated customer support channels for high-value customers.
* Offer loyalty programs or exclusive benefits to incentivize continued engagement.

By analyzing churn data and understanding the reasons behind customer departures, businesses can develop effective strategies to retain their customer base and ensure long-term growth.
